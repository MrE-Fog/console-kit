# ``ConsoleKit``

ConsoleKit provides utilities for interacting with a console via a Swift application. It provides:

* a ``Command`` type for writing commands with arguments and flags
* utilities for sending and receiving text to a terminal
* A [Swift Log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) implementation for a ``Logger`` that outputs to the console.
